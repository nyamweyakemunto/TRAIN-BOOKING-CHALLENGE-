# TRAIN-BOOKING-CHALLENGE-
Welcome to the Train Booking Database Challenge! 🎉

In this project, we’re going to work together as a team to build a train booking system database from scratch. You’ll design tables, define relationships, and create a working model for a booking system that could literally power a train station! 🚉

📝 What’s the Goal?
We’re building a train booking system database where we:

Design an ERD (Entity-Relationship Diagram) – Create entities like train stations, passengers, and bookings.
Build the Database Schema – Define tables, relationships, and constraints to keep things running smoothly.
Populate with Data – Fill it with real-world information to make sure it works perfectly.
Share on GitHub – Post everything in this repo for everyone to see!

💡 Why Should You Join?
This challenge is the perfect way to:

Collaborate with your team to solve a real-world problem 🤝
Improve your skills in database design and implementation 📊
Have fun while building something useful 🚀
⏰ Timeline
We’ve got 4 days to complete this challenge, so let’s make the most of it! 💪

Day 1: Create the ERD
Define entities (train stations, passengers, bookings, etc.) and their relationships.
Identify primary and foreign keys, and document the structure.
Day 2: Design the Database Schema
Create tables, define constraints (primary keys, foreign keys), and ensure everything is in place.
Day 3: Populate with Sample Data
Insert meaningful and realistic data to test the system’s integrity.
Make sure everything connects properly.
Day 4: Final Touches and Presentation
Finalize the database schema.
Update the ERD if needed and get ready to present your hard work!
📁 What’s Inside?
ERD: A clear visual representation of your database design.
booking.sql: The SQL file that contains the schema and sample data.
GitHub Repo: All your work will be hosted on github.

🏆 Evaluation Criteria
We’ll be judged based on the following:

Database Design (30%): Proper ERD implementation, correct use of primary and foreign keys.
Sample Data (20%): Meaningful and diverse data with correct foreign key relationships.
ERD (20%): Clear, readable, and accurate ERD reflecting the final schema.
Presentation (20%): Confidently explaining your design and how it works.
Adherence to Timeframe (10%): Meeting the 4-day deadline.
 

🚀 Let’s Do This!
Now, let’s get coding, designing, and having fun as we create the best train booking system ever! 🎉

Work with your peer group, keep everything organized, and let’s make this happen! 🌟

Deadline: 10th Jan ⏰
